# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using javascript

As simple as it might sound, this game involves some good logic and concepts invloved.

This project is less about coding and more about learning the problems solving skills learnt it the previous module.

It really helps to break down the problems in to to many sub problems and working your way through each steps.

It also improves your testing skills.
